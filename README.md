# Frontend Development AHK helper files

This is a set of 3 AHK scripts for Windows, AutoHotKey that make the process of doing frontend development easier. 

## Features:
- **Always on top**: The browser will always remain on top even if you are writing code in the ide, so you can resize it and monitor the changes you are doing.
- **Middle mouse to click to drag window**: You can middleclick and drag anywhere in the browser and it will drag the window around.
- **Opacity control**: ctrl + shift + scroll mouse to control the opacity of the screen
